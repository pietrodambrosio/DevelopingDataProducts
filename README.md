### About 
This application is based on the Bank of Italy SIOPE data base.

SIOPE is an Information System that collect all economical and financial operations of Italian public offices.

The SIOPE system is managed by the Bank of Italy, Istat and Italian General Accounting Office and is an electronic detection system of receipts and payments made by local government offices.

In this application we show you some SIOPE data on the cash availability of italian municipalities, grouped by region.

In particular the 'TREND' page shows periodic trends in 4 different accounting entries. Instead the 'CURRENT' page displays on a choropleth map the cash situation referred to May 2016.
